JettyWTPPlugin
==============

The Jetty WTP Adaptor allows you to use Eclipse and its Web Tools Platform (WTP) to develop your web applications.

If you want to just install the plugin, you can install the most current one from my site

I did add the ability to install Jetty 9.1, but have yet to test so that is considered experimental at this point.

Enjoy!
