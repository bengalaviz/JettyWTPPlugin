JettyWTPPlugin
==============

The Jetty WTP Adaptor allows you to use Eclipse and its Web Tools Platform (WTP) to develop your web applications.

If you want to just install the plugin, you can install the most current one from my site

Jetty 9 is being worked on currently and I will post an update once it is ready for testing.

Enjoy!
